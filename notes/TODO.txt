Project title: "Real Estate Price Search and Prediction API"

# -------------

Scope: The main goal of this project is to create a strong project to showcase software engineering skills on resume. We are trying to create a RESTful API with housing prices data - taken from Zillow dataset. We can create a website with dropdowns and other filters. Showcase the prices of properties in the selected region. ALso showcase some map vizualiation based on location data like city names, states, zip codes etc. We can show price trends as charts as well. We will also have ML component where we forecast the price of the real estate in the selected region. We can add in other functionality as we go and project develops.

Tech Stack: Main Backend programming language: Python 
Frontend Framework: Vue.js 
API Framework: FastAPI 
Database: SQLite, SQLAlchemy or MySQL 
Frontend Framework: Vue.js 
Machine Learning Libraries: Scikit-learn, PyTorch 
Mapping & Geospatial Tools: Leaflet.js 
Containerization: Docker 
Testing: PyTest for unit testing, Postman for API testing 
Documentation: Swagger/OpenAPI for API documentation
Version Control: GitHub

You can check directories like following: 
(only high level dirs are listed with their functionality)
data, # Data Directory
data_analysis_preprocessing, # Data Analysis Directory
data_viz, # stores local data vizualiations
ml # Machine Learning Directory, for forecasting models
real_estate_api,  # Backend (FastAPI) Directory
notes, # ignore - for personal notes
real_estate_frontend,    # Frontend (Vue.js) Directory
docker-compose.yml           # Docker Compose file to manage both services
README.md                    # Project documentation

I have decided following workflow for the user interface (flexible, may change as needed):
In first dropdown, user selects state, 
In second, user also selects region, 
Then user selects one of the features(price, ratios etc.) for which they would like to see data & forecast
They click on the search button
we display latest data - from past 6 months to the user - this data is monthly value of the requested price, ratio or other 
    requested feature for the last 6 months; from that rgion. (Not individual properties.)
we also show the chart of the requested feature values over this period. 
Then we specify the forecasted value as returned by the ml model.

You can access contents of the files to check details. 
The last time we talked and asked 
you about next steps, you had suggested following: 
"Next Steps
Enhance Search Form:

Add dropdowns for state selection.
Add more search criteria (e.g., price range, number of bedrooms/bathrooms).
Improve Property List:

Add sorting and filtering options.
Enhance the UI with better styling.
Enhance Map View:

Add clustering for markers.
Improve map styling and interactions.
Add Charts and Analytics:

Integrate charting libraries (e.g., Chart.js) to display analytics.
Create components for displaying charts (e.g., price trends, average prices).
Machine Learning Integration:

Implement ML models for price prediction.
Create endpoints in FastAPI for ML predictions.
Integrate ML predictions into the frontend
"

However, I had decided to first do data handling and ML model development. That part is now done.
We have the region-wise forecasting models ready to prpvide forecast and we now can focus on 
interface & API.

Now, help me create the code for this project.

# -------------------- PROJECT STACK -------------------------------------
Done:
    data prep - Pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib
        data exploration & visualization
        data pre-processing & cleaning

    ML - PyTorch

    API - FastAPI

    Frontend - VueJS

    version control - git

# -------------------------------

Today: 
    Update UI and backend
        to support prices like mean, median etc.
        to support granularity levels of weekly and monthly models

    Issue resolution- some regions/states dont have requested features.
    
    Code cleanup & re-org

    Deployment - docker

    
# -------------------------------

Testing:
	    PyTest

# -------------------------------

    CI/CD: 
	    GitHub actions

    Database
	    MySQL

# -------------------------------

    Documentation: 
	    Sphinx, MkDocs, Swagger (for API documentation)

    Authentication & Authorization: 
	    Implementing user authentication (e.g., OAuth, JWT) and role-based access control for security.

# -------------------------------

    Monitoring & Logging: 
	    Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack.
